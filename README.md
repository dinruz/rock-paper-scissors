## Overview

This project was assigned by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), as part of Foundations Curse. 
It's developed in two phases, demonstrating a progression from fundamental logic to advanced DOM manipulation.

### Phase 1: Console Logic 

* Implemented core **game logic** (win/loss conditions).

* Used **`if/else`** statements and a **`for` loop** to control the game flow.

* Handled **random computer selections** using `Math.random()`.

### Phase 2: UI Implementation

* **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically updating scores, messages and PC choices; counting rounds.

* **Event Handling:** 

  - Implemented **click Event Listeners** to handle player input (replacing the use of `prompt()` from first phase).

  - Implemented 'New Game' functionality to fully **reset the game state**.
  
  - Implemented 'Random Funfact', trivia about the game, using `Math.random()` to select from a predefined array.

## Technical Details 

### Built with 


* **HTML5** (Semantic structure)
* **CSS3** (Custom fonts, Flexbox for layout)
* Vanilla **JavaScript** (Core logic, DOM interaction)
* Visual Studio Code

### How to Play

1. Open the [Live site](https://dinruz.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/).

2. **Gameplay Mechanics** üïπÔ∏è

    - Initiate a round by clicking one of the three hand shapes (Rock, Paper or Scissors).

    - The PC's move and the round's result will be instantly displayed in the *Results* section.

    - The match continues until one player reaches a score of 5 points, at which point the final winner is declared.

    - Click the *New Game* to reset the match and start a new one.

    - Click *Reveal Funfact* for game trivia.

3. **Win Conditions**

    * Each shape can beat only one other shape (1 pt.):

        * Rock beats Scissors
        * Scissors beats Paper
        * Paper beats Rock
    *  Matching moves result in a Tie (0 pts.).
