## Overview

This project was assigned by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), as part of Foundations Curse. 
It's developed in two phases, demonstrating a progression from fundamental logic to advanced DOM manipulation.

### Phase 1: Console Logic 

* Implemented core **game logic** (win/loss conditions).

* Used **`if/else`** statements and a **`for` loop** to control the game flow.

* Handled **random computer selections** using `Math.random()`.

### Phase 2: UI Implementation

* **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically updating scores, messages, and PC choices.

* **Event Handling:** Implementing **click Event Listeners** to handle player input, replacing the use of `prompt()`.

 ¬∞| Funcionality | Status   
:---  | :--- | :--- | 
1 | Core Game Logic | ‚úÖ Completed 
2 | UI Interactivity| ‚úÖ Completed  
3 | Responsivness   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited  *                 


**This project primarily focuses on demonstrating core JS logic and DOM manipulation.* 
*It's designed for standard desktop viewport resolutions and is **not fully responsive** for mobile devices (potential future enhancement).*

## Technical Details 

### Built with 


* **HTML5** (Semantic structure)
* **CSS3** (Custom fonts, Flexbox for layout)
* **JavaScript** (Core logic, DOM interaction)
* **Visual Studio Code**

### How to Play

1.  Open the **Live Demo** link above.
2.  **Gameplay Mechanics** üïπÔ∏è

    - To initiate a round, simply click on one of the three hand shapes (Rock, Paper or Scissors).

    - The PC's move will be instantly revealed. The *Results* section will update with the round's outcome and the current score tally.

    - The game continues automatically until one player secures 5 points. Once the score is reached, the final winner will be declared.

3. **Win Conditions**

    - Rock crushes Scissors (1 pt).
    - Scissors cuts Paper (1 pt).
    - Paper covers Rock (1 pt).
    - Matching moves result in a **Tie** (0 pts).
